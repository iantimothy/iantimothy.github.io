    <h1>First smart contract deployed</h1>
    <p>1/ Just deployed my first smart contract. Rather harrowing as there's no such thing as rollbacks.</p>
    <p>While NFTs seem to be about art and community now, NFTs have use cases beyond those. One of them is Lineage.</p>

    <p>2/ The linked article resurfaced a question I had previously pondered - how might we be certain someone is truly part of a family?</p>
    <p>In Chinese culture, there is a tradition to record genealogy in a type of book called the 族谱 (zupu).</p>

    <hr/>
    <p>3/ A family's book would be entrusted to a single individual for protection and maintenance.</p>
    <p>As families grew and people migrated, one can imagine the flow of information to and from the keeper of the book becoming harder.</p>
    <hr/>  
    <p>4/ The physical nature of the book made it susceptible to be lost, damaged, or destroyed.</p> 
    <p>What if this information is stored on-chain? What if lineage can be recorded and verified across time and space, immutable and everlasting.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>5/ The Lineage contract is my attempt to experiment with this idea.</p>
    <p>Each address can only hold one Lineage Token.</p> 
    <p>There is no self-minting. Only someone with a token can mint for another.</p>
    <p>If you transfer your token, you lose the right to mint.</p>
    <p>One address, one mint.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>6/ It is common for wealthier families to have physical symbols of lineage.</p>
    <p>One such symbol is the signet ring that is typically engraved with the family's crest.</p>
    <p>Wealthy families might craft their rings with silver, royalty with gold.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>7/ One can imagine that if lineage is stored on-chain, a chain's higher cost for transactions is a desirable property.</p>
    <p>Royalty will deploy their lineage contract on ETH (or whatever is more expensive once ETH 2.0 arrives).  Others will deploy their lineage on a L2 chain.</p>
