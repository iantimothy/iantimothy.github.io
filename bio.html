    <h2>the longer introduction</h2>
    <p>I practice product management during the day and perform standup comedy at night. I work with product managers, data scientists, designers, marketers, business development executives, and engineers to deliver the right product to the right users at the right time.</p>
    <p>I was one of the three co-founders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honestbee">honestbee</a>. I left in 2018 to pursue my own path. In her halycon days, honestbee was in eight markets - Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong - delivering food and groceries to customers that loved her service. I had the privilege of working with a dedicated, intelligent, and capable team of engineers, product managers, data scientists, and designers who have found new and better homes.</p>
    <p>In 2019, I traveled from Singapore to London by land using buses and trains. Along the way I performed standup comedy culminating in winning the June edition of the brutal <a href="https://london.thecomedystore.co.uk/event/king-gong/">King Gong at The Comedy Store London</a>. I have performed standup comedy live in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Chongqing, Beijing, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Warsaw, Berlin, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London.</p>
    <p>Because of the late, inimitable and generous Vernon Lewis I have hosted and performed at the Magners International Comedy Festival. I was also once Comedy Central Asia's comedian of the month.</p>
    <p>For the startup part of my life, I love moderating panels and interviewing noteworthy individuals. I have had the honor of moderating sessions with <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/entrepreneurs-and-investors-pour-grievances-during-dr-tony-tan-qa">President Tony Tan</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/listening-also-important-when-advocating-says-president-halimah-yacob-to-young-people">President Halimah Yacob</a>. I enjoy facilitating the telling of stories and communication of messages.</p>
